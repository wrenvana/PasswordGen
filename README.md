<h1>Password Generator</h1>

The purpose is to generate a password of randomized characters to enhance user security. The generator will give the user the option of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers to use as well as prompting the user to choose a length between 8 and 100 characters. The generator will alert the user if they choose an invalid password length or do not choose any values for the character types.

The password generator is deployed at "https://wrenvana.github.io/PasswordGen/".
